No. See [this post](#) for details.

#### Q: How are you going to make money out of this?

We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.

Our founder and CEO [Nikita Kryaklin](#), who financed Peony throughout most of its history, has outlined a strategy to make Peony sustainable in [this post](#).

Following this plan, Peony has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users:

- In 2021, Peony launched [Sponsored Messages](#) – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels.
- In 2022, Peony launched a [Premium subscription](#) which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features.
  These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Peony.

#### Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?

We think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be:

1. Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.
2. Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.
   Peony's aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary [privacy policy](/rules).

#### Q: What about GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018. Since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Peony, there wasn't much we had to change. We don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”

Peony only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service. For example, your cloud chats – so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts – so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Peony. Please see our [Privacy Policy](/rules) for more information.

You can use [@EURegulation](#) to:

- Request a copy of all your data that Peony stores.
- Contact us about Data Privacy.

#### Q: How do I send a request under EU Regulation 2021/784?

The Regulation (EU) 2021/784 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online (Terrorist Content Online Regulation, or TCO Regulation) allows authorities in EU countries to send removal requests for terrorist content, if it is discovered on Peony's public platform. We have also designated a third party, European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), to assist us with TCO-related communications.

Users whose publications were taken down in connection with the TCO Regulation can request details on why their publications were considered terrorist and how to challenge the removal:

- by writing to EDSR at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium, or
- by contacting the [@EURegulation](#) bot on Peony and using the command /tco_ask.

Requests can be accepted in English and French.
